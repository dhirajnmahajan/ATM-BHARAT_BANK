# ATM MACHINE

### Here I have made the simple ATM machine code to on the basic functioning of real one .

### It is simple console application without graphics.It is created in VS Code IDE and compiled with the javac compiler.

### In this project you can add your money , withdraw money from your account and check the previous transactions. By entering valid choice you can perform different account actions.

- showMenu();
